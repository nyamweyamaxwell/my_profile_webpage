<h1 style="font-size:60px;"> The Visitor's advance </h1>
<p>I had expected the world before him to be disintegrating, 
had expected there to be rocks, soil and garbage floating 
out of the ground in the light of his advance, but all I could see was a 
cluster of shapes, casting barely visibly shadows as they drifted about his 
stooped and lurching form. It was this, more than anything else, that convinced 
me that the Visitor was in some way diminished. Perhaps my gamble with the black 
mud had paid off after all, or perhaps the darkness really was eroding the
 Visitor’s strength. Whatever the case, I was sure that this boded well 
 for us. Firm ground, capricious though it was, meant that we could run, 
 and though I knew it to be unlikely, I begun to entertain the possibility 
 that we could get away.</p>

It was with an effort that I managed
</p>

<p style="color:red">  It was with an effort that I managed to turn the focus of my thoughts to ground beneath my feet. I had slipped several times by then, and as we got further and further from the camp, the going seemed to only be getting more difficult. I had imagined that the wall we had crossed to get here in some way surrounded the camp, and that we would have to cross it if we were to find our way back out into the pitch black world beyond, but we never found it. What happened instead was that the colour slowly faded from the world as we got further and further from the camp, till in the end, the lights of the fires behind us vanished, and we were once again moving through a world black as pitch in all direction. The only difference now, was that we were using the false light of the visitor’s aura, rather than the concentrated presence of the Nameless Earth, to orient ourselves.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:60px;"> Futility </h1>


<pre style="color:blue">
<b>Where will you go?</b>
<em>Where will you go</em>
if you do not know
that the world is cold 
and eats the bold?

<i>E'en the longest path </i>
still leads to death
E'en cowards die 
where heroes lie.

Where will you turn
if you cannot run
from all you've done
and what's to come?

The world is round 
and you are bound
to come back in 
where you begin.

Where will you hide
T'escape the tide
'f no earthly flight
can escape the night?

All shall fade
into the shade
night of nothing
like the beginning.
</pre>
