<p>I had expected the world before him to be disintegrating, 
had expected there to be rocks, soil and garbage floating 
out of the ground in the light of his advance, but all I could see was a 
cluster of shapes, casting barely visibly shadows as they drifted about his 
stooped and lurching form. It was this, more than anything else, that convinced 
me that the Visitor was in some way diminished. Perhaps my gamble with the black 
mud had paid off after all, or perhaps the darkness really was eroding the
 Visitorâ€™s strength. Whatever the case, I was sure that this boded well 
 for us. Firm ground, capricious though it was, meant that we could run, 
 and though I knew it to be unlikely, I begun to entertain the possibility 
 that we could get away.</p>
